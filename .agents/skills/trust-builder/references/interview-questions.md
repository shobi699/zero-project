# Interview Questions

Structured questions for Phase 1. Ask via AskUserQuestion tool, one at a time or batched as appropriate.

## Question 1: Base URL

**Ask:** "What is the app's base URL for live browser exploration?"

**Why this matters:** The Live App Experience agent needs a target URL to explore the app as a first-time user.

**How this informs analysis:** The base URL determines what the browser agent explores. If the app isn't deployed yet, the Live App Experience agent is skipped and the analysis relies on codebase exploration only. Record "no URL" in Interview task metadata so Phase 2 knows to skip the browser agent.

## Question 2: Primary Audience

**Ask:** "Who is the primary audience for this app?"

**Options to offer (via AskUserQuestion):**
- Content creators / influencers
- Educators / schools / institutions
- Enterprise / corporate teams
- General consumers
- Developers / technical users
- Other (free text)

**Why this matters:** Different audiences value different trust signals. Educators value privacy (FERPA, student data). Enterprise values security and compliance. Consumers value free access and simplicity. Creators value speed and shareability.

**How this informs analysis:** Audience type determines which trust-building patterns are most impactful. Privacy-focused audiences → client-side processing emphasis. Speed-focused audiences → free demo emphasis. Compliance-focused audiences → transparency emphasis.

## Question 3: Monetization Model

**Ask:** "What's the current or planned monetization model?"

**Options to offer:**
- SaaS subscription (monthly/annual)
- Usage-based pricing (pay per use)
- Freemium (free tier + paid upgrades)
- One-time purchase
- Not monetized yet / exploring options
- Other (free text)

**Why this matters:** The monetization model determines the free→paid funnel. A SaaS app needs free features that create upgrade pressure. A not-yet-monetized app needs free features that build an audience for future monetization.

**How this informs analysis:** Shapes the "Funnel mechanics" section of each mini-spec.

## Question 4: Trust Definition

**Ask:** "What does 'trust' mean for your users? What would make them confident in your app?"

**Options to offer:**
- Privacy (data never leaves their device)
- Accuracy / reliability (the app works correctly)
- Transparency (they can see how it works)
- Free access (try before you buy)
- Social proof (others use and recommend it)
- Other (free text)

**Why this matters:** Trust is not monolithic. The same app could build trust through privacy OR through social proof — the right choice depends on the audience.

**How this informs analysis:** Determines which trust signals to prioritize in the report's "Current Trust Signals" table and which opportunities rank highest.

## Question 5: Conversion Funnel

**Ask:** "Is there a specific conversion funnel you're optimizing for?"

**Options to offer:**
- Free tool → signup → paid subscription
- Content/SEO → landing page → signup
- Word of mouth / viral sharing → organic growth
- No funnel yet / building awareness first
- Other (free text)

**Why this matters:** The funnel context determines how free offerings should be positioned — as a top-of-funnel awareness play, a mid-funnel trust builder, or a bottom-funnel conversion driver.

**How this informs analysis:** Shapes where in the user journey each opportunity should be placed.

## Question 6: Constraints

**Ask:** "Are there any constraints on what you can offer for free?"

**Options to offer:**
- API costs (can't afford unlimited free usage of paid APIs)
- Compute costs (server-side processing is expensive)
- Competitive sensitivity (don't want to give away core IP)
- No significant constraints
- Other (free text)

**Why this matters:** Constraints determine which opportunities are feasible. If API costs are a concern, client-side processing opportunities rank higher. If competitive sensitivity matters, open-source components rank lower.

**How this informs analysis:** Acts as a filter on opportunity feasibility.

## Question 7: Competitive Verification (Phase 4)

**Ask:** "Would you like me to also explore competitor apps to verify your free offerings would be differentiated?"

**Options to offer:**
- Yes, check competitors
- No, skip competitive analysis

**Why this matters:** Competitive verification ensures proposed free features aren't "me too" offerings.

**How this informs analysis:** Determines whether Phase 4 runs. Store preference in Interview task metadata as `phase4_opted_in: true/false`.
